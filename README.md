# 1-GNN-Clustering

This is the complimentary code for the WIDECOMM 2023 Paper Submission: "Edge Clustering and Communication Efficiency with GNNs in the Internet of Vehicles." This code contains the K-Means Clustering model with three GNN approaches, GAT, GCN, and GraphSAGE and compares against a baseline approach with just K-Means. To use a specific GNN, you must modify the encoder to reflect these parameters. 

Enjoy!
